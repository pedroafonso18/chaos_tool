This is a chaos tool created by and for Pedro Afonso, tailored for my specific use cases.

## Current Features
- **CPU Hogger:** Simulate high CPU usage by allocating multiple cores for a specified duration.
- **RAM Hogger:** Simulate high memory usage by allocating a specified amount of RAM for a specified duration.

## Planned Features
- **Database Failure Simulation:** Tools to simulate database outages or failures.
- **Max Users in Database:** Simulate scenarios where the database reaches its maximum user capacity.
- **VM Shutdown Simulation:** Simulate virtual machine shutdown events for resilience testing.
